# Spin-Torque RL-Gym Project Charter

## Project Overview

**Project Name**: Spin-Torque RL-Gym  
**Project Lead**: Daniel Schmidt, Terragon Labs  
**Charter Date**: August 2, 2025  
**Charter Version**: 1.0  

## Executive Summary

Spin-Torque RL-Gym is an open-source reinforcement learning environment that enables AI agents to learn optimal control strategies for spintronic devices. By providing physically accurate simulations of magnetization dynamics, the project bridges cutting-edge spintronics research with modern machine learning to accelerate the development of next-generation neuromorphic computing and magnetic memory technologies.

## Problem Statement

### Current Challenges in Spintronics Control

**Manual Protocol Design**: Current spintronic device optimization relies on expert intuition and extensive trial-and-error experiments, leading to:
- Suboptimal switching protocols with high energy consumption
- Limited exploration of complex multi-pulse sequences
- Weeks-to-months development cycles for new devices
- Difficulty scaling optimization to large device arrays

**Simulation-Reality Gap**: Existing micromagnetic simulators:
- Lack integration with machine learning frameworks
- Focus on single-device analysis rather than control optimization
- Require extensive physics expertise to operate effectively
- Don't provide standardized benchmarking for AI applications

**Research Fragmentation**: Spintronics and AI communities operate independently:
- Limited cross-pollination of ideas and techniques
- Inconsistent performance metrics across studies
- Difficulty reproducing and comparing results
- No standardized platforms for collaborative research
