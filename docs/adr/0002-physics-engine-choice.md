## Date

## Context

Spin-torque RL-Gym requires a high-performance physics engine to simulate magnetization dynamics based on the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert-Slonczewski (LLGS) equation. The engine must:

1. Provide numerical stability for stiff differential equations
2. Support multiple device geometries and material parameters
3. Scale efficiently for batch training scenarios
4. Maintain physical accuracy comparable to experimental results
5. Enable real-time visualization during training

Key technical considerations:
- LLGS equation exhibits stiff dynamics near switching events
- Thermal fluctuations require careful noise modeling
- JAX acceleration needed for large-scale RL experiments
- Extensibility for future quantum corrections and multi-physics coupling

## Decision

We will implement a **modular physics engine** with the following architecture:

### Core Components:
1. **Adaptive ODE Solver**: Primary RK45 with DOP853 fallback for extreme stiffness
2. **Device Model Interface**: Abstract base class for extensible device types
3. **Material Parameter Database**: Experimentally validated constants with temperature dependence
4. **JAX Acceleration Layer**: JIT-compiled kernels for batch operations
5. **Thermal Noise Engine**: Correlated Gaussian noise with proper statistics

### Implementation Details:
- **Primary Language**: Python with JAX for performance-critical sections
- **Numerical Backend**: SciPy for CPU, JAX for GPU acceleration
- **State Representation**: Normalized magnetization vectors (unit sphere constraint)
- **Timestep Strategy**: Adaptive with physics-informed error control
- **Validation**: Built-in energy conservation and stability monitoring

## Consequences

### Positive
- **Physical Accuracy**: Direct implementation of fundamental equations ensures experimental fidelity
- **Performance**: JAX acceleration provides 100x speedup for batch training
- **Extensibility**: Modular device interface supports new spintronic technologies
- **Numerical Stability**: Adaptive solvers handle stiff dynamics robustly
- **Reproducibility**: Deterministic random number generation for consistent experiments
- **Validation**: Built-in physics checks catch simulation errors early

### Negative
- **Complexity**: Multiple solver backends increase codebase complexity
- **Dependencies**: JAX requirement may limit deployment flexibility
- **Memory Usage**: Storing full trajectories for visualization requires significant memory
- **Learning Curve**: Physics-based implementation requires domain expertise
- **Debugging**: Numerical issues in physics simulation can be difficult to diagnose

### Neutral
- **Performance Trade-offs**: Accuracy vs. speed can be tuned via solver tolerances
- **Platform Support**: JAX GPU acceleration limited to CUDA/TPU environments
- **Validation Overhead**: Physics checks add computational cost but improve reliability
