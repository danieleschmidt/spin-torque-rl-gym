## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the Spin-Torque RL-Gym project, please report it responsibly by following these guidelines:

### How to Report

1. **Do NOT create a public GitHub issue** for security vulnerabilities
2. **Email us directly** at: security@spinrl.com (when available) or danieleschmidt@users.noreply.github.com
3. **Use encrypted communication** when possible (PGP key available on request)

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Type of vulnerability** (e.g., code injection, privilege escalation, etc.)
- **Component or file** where the vulnerability was found
- **Step-by-step instructions** to reproduce the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** of the vulnerability
- **Suggested mitigation** if you have one
- **Your contact information** for follow-up questions

### Response Timeline

We commit to the following response timeline:

- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment of your report
- **72 hours**: Initial assessment and severity classification
- **7 days**: Detailed response with our investigation findings
- **30 days**: Security fix released (for confirmed vulnerabilities)

### Severity Classification

We use the following severity levels based on CVSS 3.1:

| Severity | CVSS Score | Response Time |
|----------|------------|---------------|
| Critical | 9.0-10.0   | 24 hours      |
| High     | 7.0-8.9    | 72 hours      |
| Medium   | 4.0-6.9    | 7 days        |
| Low      | 0.1-3.9    | 14 days       |

## Security Best Practices

### For Users

When using the Spin-Torque RL-Gym environment:

1. **Keep dependencies updated**: Regularly update to the latest version
2. **Validate inputs**: Sanitize any external data used in simulations
3. **Secure environments**: Run simulations in isolated environments when processing untrusted data
4. **Monitor resources**: Be aware of computational resource usage to prevent DoS conditions

### For Contributors

When contributing to the project:

1. **Follow secure coding practices**:
   - Validate all inputs and parameters
   - Use parameterized queries for any database operations
   - Avoid hardcoded secrets or credentials
   - Implement proper error handling without information disclosure

2. **Use security tools**:
   - Run `bandit` for Python security analysis
   - Use `safety` to check for known vulnerabilities in dependencies
   - Follow the pre-commit hooks that include security checks

3. **Code review requirements**:
   - All security-related changes require review from the security team
   - Critical components require two approvals
   - Security tests must pass before merging

## Security Features

### Current Security Measures

1. **Dependency Management**:
   - Automated dependency vulnerability scanning with Dependabot
   - Regular security updates for critical dependencies
   - License compliance checking

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - Static code analysis with CodeQL
   - Security linting with Bandit
   - Regular security scans in CI/CD pipeline

3. **Container Security**:
   - Multi-stage Docker builds to minimize attack surface
   - Non-root user in production containers
   - Regular base image updates
   - Container vulnerability scanning with Trivy

4. **Access Control**:
   - Branch protection rules requiring code review
   - Signed commits requirement for critical branches
   - Two-factor authentication requirement for maintainers

5. **Secret Management**:
   - No secrets in source code
   - GitHub Secrets for sensitive configuration
   - Secret scanning enabled to prevent accidental commits

### Ongoing Security Initiatives

1. **SLSA Compliance**:
   - Working towards SLSA Level 3 compliance
   - Build provenance and integrity verification
   - Supply chain security improvements

2. **Security Monitoring**:
   - Real-time vulnerability monitoring
   - Security incident response procedures
   - Regular security assessments

## Known Security Considerations

### Physics Simulation Security

1. **Input Validation**:
   - All physics parameters are validated for reasonable ranges
   - Malformed simulation parameters cannot crash the environment
   - Resource limits prevent excessive computation

2. **Numerical Stability**:
   - Robust numerical methods prevent overflow/underflow exploits
   - Error handling for edge cases in magnetic field calculations
   - Safe defaults for all simulation parameters

### Machine Learning Security

1. **Model Safety**:
   - Training environments are isolated
   - No execution of arbitrary code from model parameters
   - Resource monitoring during training

2. **Data Integrity**:
   - Validation of observation and action spaces
   - Protection against adversarial inputs to trained models
   - Secure handling of experimental data

## Vulnerability History
